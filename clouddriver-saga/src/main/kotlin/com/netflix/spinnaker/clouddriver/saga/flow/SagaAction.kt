/**
 * A discrete action in a [Saga].
 *
 * When the Saga reaches this action, it will refresh the latest [Saga] context and persist a snapshot marker
 * to the event store once the action has been applied successfully.
 *
 * A [SagaAction] must be written such that it is reentrant and idempotent in the case of client-invoked
 * retries (due to internal or downstream system failure). Upon completion of an Action, it can emit 0 to N
 * [SagaCommand]s and 0 to N [SagaEvent]s. Only [SagaCommand]s will be able to move a [Saga]'s progress forward,
 * whereas a [SagaEvent] will just notify interested parties of changes within the system.
