== Cloud Foundry - OORT Concepts

OORT has a set of interfaces. The idea is to map Cloud Foundry concepts onto this model to get maximum support when plugging into the rest of spinnaker. The following table covers this. To consume the table, remember that CF applications map 1-to-1 with Spinnaker server groups.

| OORT object | Details | Cloud Foundry object

|`Application`
|contains:

* 0..N `Cluster`

|A single application found on github. Can be found deployed in multiple units across multiple CF spaces (even on different CF installations).

* sagan

|`Cluster`
|contains:

* 0..N `ServerGroup`
* 0..N `SecurityGroup`
* 1 account name/CF space

|An application deployed to a single space. An account is essentially CF credentials + a CF space. Imagine sagan installed into various spaces. NOTE: This is NOT enough for an ACTUAL deployed instance inside CF. This is an aggregation of server groups (see below).

* account: production, cluster: sagan-main
* account: staging, cluster: sagan-main
* account: development, cluster: sagan-main

or

* account: sagan, cluster: sagan-production
* account: sagan, cluster: sagan-production
* account: sagan, cluster: sagan-development

The "main", "production", "staging", and "development" bits are called Spinnaker stacks and act as a logical grouping for one system.

|`ServerGroup`
|contains:

* 0..N `Instance`
* 0..N `LoadBalancer`
* 0..N `SecurityGroup`
* 1 region
* 0..N zones
* 0..N launchConfig

|

* sagan-main-v001
** Region(org): spring.io
** Zone(space): production
** SecurityGroups(services): redis-service, mongodb-service

* sagan-main-v002
** Region(org): spring.io
** Zone(space): production
** SecurityGroups(services): redis-service, mongodb-service

* sagan-main-v003
** Region(org): spring.io
** Zone(space): production
** SecurityGroups(services): redis-service, mongodb-service

"v001", "v002", "v003" are versions, and map 1-to-1 with versions of codes. By mapping these with a CF route, you effectively institute blue/green deployments. It's more sophisticated and allows each release of code to form an immutable CF application.

|`SecurityGroup`
|contains:

* 0..N `ServerGroup`

|Services? CF apps have services, which can bind to multiple apps. Since `SecurityGroup` can map to multiple `ServerGroup`, this would fit the relationship, even if semantically it doesn't sound right. Possible to rebrand in the UI via metadata???

* redis-service => sagan-main-v001, sagan-main-v002

|`Instance`
|contains:

* 0..N `ServerGroup`
* 0..1 zone

|Number of scaled instances of an app, whether blue/green/none type.

* sagan-main-v001:0 production
* sagan-main-v002:1 production

|Region
|The region in which the instances of this server group are known to exist

* contains 1..N zones
|Org

* https://console.run.pivotal.io/organizations/47027c3d-5d72-4429-b3ab-0e3936e916f2[FrameworksAndRuntimes] (Spring team demo org)

|Zone
|The zones within a region that the instances within this server group occupy.
|Space

* https://console.run.pivotal.io/organizations/47027c3d-5d72-4429-b3ab-0e3936e916f2/spaces/3a2dbac3-baa6-474e-8eb9-82f9182d5457[development] (Spring team demo space)
